 An open source software, focused on tracking Crayfish in a lab environment

The Software Crayfish-Traking Vision software was develop by the student Rogelio Cede√±o Moreno from the Engineering Faculty of Autonomus University of Queretaro, as a thesis topic for obtaining the degree of electromechanical engineer.
The software was designed under the specifications of the departament of physiology of the National Autonomous Mexico University, in order to support their research related with the identification of the Procambarus Clarkii physical substrates.

This software is limited to te monitoring of 1 to 4 specimens and in the actual version the specimens must be in individual areas.

The use of the software is completely free, the only thing that can be done is the recognition of the original work.

To use the software, the file "crayfish_GUI7.py" can be used as main or the setup "crayfish_GUI7.exe" can be run directly.

Thankyou!!
